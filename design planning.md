## popup functionality
- display current video info
    - thumbnail?
    - saved duration, last saved time?
	- probably don’t need:
		- name of video, uploaded, video duration, anything that’s already known because youre on the video page already
- display nothing if not valid page
- ability to save current video to database
- ability to "done" current video, if it is in the database
- clearly indicate if a video has been stored

## mainpage functionality
- list of videos
- sort functionality

### video info to display
- thumbnail
- duration of video
- current time position of video
- ~~percent in the video?~~ maybe not, kind of weird stat, makes it seem like im reading a book, not the best feeling for videos.
- title of video
- uploader?
- button to "done" the video
- time it was saved
- counter of times it was saved?
