## Youtube Watch Later Video Manager*
*temporary name?

**Youtube Watch Later Video Manager** is a chrome extension that lets you save youtube videos that you are in the middle of watching into a handy list, so you can resume watching them later at the same position. I made it because i like listening to long soundtrack videos.

### usage
- while on the page of a youtube video to save, click on the extension icon
- click save to save the video at the current position, thats it
- click on "saved videos" to go to the saved videos page
- click "done" to mark a video as completed

### saved videos
- videos saved will be shown here, sorted by last time saved
- click on their titles or thumbnail to go to the video and resume watching
- click "mark done" to mark the video as completed, thereafter the video will be shown in the "done videos" category

### why is it called ssaver
because i started the habit of saving youtube videos while watching speedruns which are actually videos. so it stands for speedrun saver.
